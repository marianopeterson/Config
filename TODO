TODO:
 *  Support pear packaging

 *  Support inline comments.
    Goal:   I want to be able to add comments to a particular line
    Example:
        public_key = ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub ;This is what I mean by an inline comment
        public_key = ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub #This is another example
        public_key = ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub //And the last example I can think of

 *  Support multiple levels of cache.
    Goal: I want to benefit from the high speed of volatile caches like APC and
          Memcache, but protect myself from incuring the penalty of reparsing
          configurations from their source.
    Example: // Add caches in the order they should be tried
             $config = Config::getInstanct();
             $config->setSource(new Config_Storage_MySQL())
                    ->addCache(new Config_Storage_APC())    // Try APC first
                    ->addCache(new Config_Storage_File());  // Fall back to File
                

GENERAL PROCESS:
access config data from source
load(sourceList):
    foreach source in sourceList:
        this->loadFromSource(source)    // splits lines using LINE_DELIMITER,
                                        // ignores comment lines and blank lines
            foreach line in source:
                parse key, type, value from line
        merge result into this->configData
