TODO:
 *  Support pear packaging

 *  Support inline comments.
    Goal:   I want to be able to add comments to a particular line
    Example:
        public_key = ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub ;This is what I mean by an inline comment
        public_key = ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub #This is another example
        public_key = ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub //And the last example I can think of


GENERAL PROCESS:
access config data from source
load(sourceList):
    foreach source in sourceList:
        this->loadFromSource(source)    // splits lines using LINE_DELIMITER,
                                        // ignores comment lines and blank lines
            foreach line in source:
                parse key, type, value from line
        merge result into this->configData
